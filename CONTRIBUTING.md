# Contribution Guidelines

To maintain a high standard of code quality and ensure smooth collaboration, please adhere to the following guidelines when contributing:

## Branching Strategy

1. **Main Branch Protection**:
    - All work must be done in separate branches created from `main`.
    - Direct pushes to the `main` branch are **prohibited**.

## Creating a Branch

1. **Branch Naming**:
    - Use descriptive names for your branches to reflect the feature or bug fix you are working on.
    - Examples:
        - `feature/add-login-functionality`
        - `bugfix/fix-header-alignment`

## Pull Requests

1. **Creating a Pull Request (PR)**:
    - Ensure your branch is up to date with the `main` branch before creating a PR.
    - Rebase your branch on top of the latest `main` branch before submitting your PR. Merge commits are **not allowed**.
    - Provide a clear and concise title for your PR, the title will be used as the entry in the release notes.
    - Include a detailed description of the changes made.

2. **PR Documentation**:
    - Clearly describe what changes have been made.
    - Include references to any relevant issues/tickets/cards.
    - Highlight any new dependencies or migration steps required.

3. **Review Process**:
    - All PRs require at least one approval from a designated reviewer.
    - Address any feedback or requested changes promptly.

## Merging

1. **Merge Approval**:
    - Once your PR has been reviewed and approved, it can be merged into the `main` branch.
    - Squash commits to keep a clean and readable commit history.

## Communication

1. **Collaboration**:
    - Keep open communication with team members and reviewers throughout the contribution process.
    - Use issue trackers and project boards to keep track of progress and updates.

## Additional Notes

1. **Documentation**:
    - Update any relevant documentation to reflect changes made in your PR.
    - Ensure README files and other guides are up to date with the latest information.
